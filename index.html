React JS is a web framework that is used to create a fast and interactive user interface for web and mobile applications. With this framework React creates an app that is visually appealing. It has been widely accepted by both developers for its easy learning curve and by companies for its SEO performance and its cross- platform operability. Today React is the most popular framework according to Stack Overflow’s data and has been adopted by industry tycoons like Netflix, Paypal, and Apple.</p>

        <h1>What kind of projects can maximize its potential from Reactjs app development?</h1>
        <p>React was originally developed for building large-scale applications. However, its versatility enables us to see a lot of use cases. Here are some of the use cases of Reactjs app development:</p>
    </div>



    <div class="part">
        <div class="part1">
            <div></div>
            <h3>Enterprise Web Apps</h3>
            <p>React enables the creation of component-based architecture. This helps us create large-scale app & since all these components are reusable it helps in curbing maintenance costs in the future.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="part2">
            <div></div>
            <h3>Dynamic Page updates</h3>
            <p>React is the framework to opt for if you have a page with a lot of dynamic components. Updating such pages becomes easy because when one component changes, the related components are updated as well.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="part3">
            <div></div>
            <h3>Progressive Web Apps</h3>
            <p>Progressive Web applications require a browser and can access the device’s credentials. They can also work offline and can provide a native experience to users.</p>
            
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="para">
        <h1>
            Frameworks that are compatible with Reactjs
        </h1>
        <p>
            The following frameworks can be coupled with Reactjs to make extremely efficient and responsive applications.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="part-03">
        <div class="part031">
            <div></div>
            <h3>React Native</h3>
            <p>React Native too allows for Reactjs app development by making use of JSX and JavaScript but unlike React, it does not use HTML for rendering purposes. Unlike React, React Native uses HTML for just the visualization of the application.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="part032">
            <div></div>
            <h3>Semantic UI</h3>
            <p>If you are hoping to create a lightweight experience for your users, then this is the framework to opt for. It enables the creation of flat and sleek components and has reusable components like elements, collection, and views.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="part033">
            <div></div>
            <h3>Material UI</h3>
            <p>This was the first-ever UI kit that was developed for React and has all the components required to design an app. This also comes with a color palette that allows developers to make a customized theme for an application.</p>            
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="z1">Apart from these frameworks, there are others like Ant. design and Elemental UI which can be used in React app development and which give users minimalistic themes for their applications.</p>
